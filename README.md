## Description
This is a [Ruby][] implementation of a [Turtle][] parser for [RDF.rb][].

## Features
RDF::Turtle parses [Turtle][Turtle] and [N-Triples][N-Triples] into statements or triples. It also serializes to Turtle.

Install with `gem install rdf-turtle`

* 100% free and unencumbered [public domain](https://unlicense.org/) software.
* Implements a complete parser for [Turtle][].
* Compatible with Ruby >= 2.2.2.
* Optional streaming writer, to serialize large graphs

## Usage
Instantiate a reader from a local file:

    graph = RDF::Graph.load("etc/doap.ttl", format:  :ttl)

Define `@base` and `@prefix` definitions, and use for serialization using `:base_uri` an `:prefixes` options.

Canonicalize and validate using `:canonicalize` and `:validate` options.

Write a graph to a file:

    RDF::Turtle::Writer.open("etc/test.ttl") do |writer|
       writer << graph
    end

## Documentation
Full documentation available on [Rubydoc.info][Turtle doc]

### Principle Classes
* {RDF::Turtle::Format}
* {RDF::Turtle::Reader}
* {RDF::Turtle::Writer}

### Variations from the spec
In some cases, the specification is unclear on certain issues:

* The LC version of the [Turtle][] specification separates rules for `@base` and `@prefix` with closing '.' from the SPARQL-like `BASE` and `PREFIX` without closing '.'. This version implements a more flexible syntax where the `@` and closing `.` are optional and `base/prefix` are matched case independently.
* Additionally, both `a` and `A` match `rdf:type`.

### Freebase-specific Reader
There is a special reader useful for processing [Freebase Dumps][]. To invoke
this, add the `freebase:  true` option to the {RDF::Turtle::Reader.new}, or
use {RDF::Turtle::FreebaseReader} directly. As with {RDF::Turtle::Reader},
prefix definitions may be passed in using the `:prefixes` option to
RDF::Turtle::FreebaseReader} using the standard mechanism defined
for `RDF::Reader`.

The [Freebase Dumps][] have a very normalized form, similar to N-Triples but
with prefixes. They also have a large amount of garbage. This Reader is
optimized for this format and will perform faster error recovery.

An example of reading Freebase dumps:

    require "rdf/turtle"
    fb = "../freebase/freebase-rdf-2013-03-03-00-00.ttl"
    fb_prefixes = {
      ns:  "http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/",
      key:  "http://rdf.freebase.com/key/",
      owl:  "http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>",
      rdfs:  "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#",
      rdf:  "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#",
      xsd:  "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#"
    }
    RDF::Turtle::Reader.open(fb,
      freebase:  true,
      prefixes:  fb_prefixes) do |r|

      r.each_statement {|stmt| puts stmt.to_ntriples}
    end

## Implementation Notes
This version uses a hand-written parser using the Lexer from the [EBNF][] gem instead of a general [EBNF][] LL(1) parser for faster performance.

## Dependencies

* [Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org/) (>= 2.2)

## Contributing
This repository uses [Git Flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) to mange development and release activity. All submissions _must_ be on a feature branch based on the _develop_ branch to ease staging and integration.

* Do your best to adhere to the existing coding conventions and idioms.
* Don't use hard tabs, and don't leave trailing whitespace on any line.
* Do document every method you add using [YARD][] annotations. Read the
  [tutorial][YARD-GS] or just look at the existing code for examples.
* Don't touch the `.gemspec`, `VERSION` or `AUTHORS` files. If you need to
  change them, do so on your private branch only.
* Do feel free to add yourself to the `CREDITS` file and the corresponding
  list in the the `README`. Alphabetical order applies.
* Do note that in order for us to merge any non-trivial changes (as a rule
  of thumb, additions larger than about 15 lines of code), we need an
  explicit [public domain dedication][PDD] on record from you.
